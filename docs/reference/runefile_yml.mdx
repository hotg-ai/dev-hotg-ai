The primary way to create a Rune is by using a text file in the YAML format,
referred to as a Runefile, to declare how a machine learning pipeline is
configured.

<details>
<summary>A typical Runefile.</summary>

```yaml
image: runicos/base

pipeline:
  rand:
    capability: RAND
    outputs:
      - type: F32
        dimensions: [1]

  mod360:
    proc-block: "hotg-ai/rune#proc_blocks/modulo"
    inputs:
      - rand
    outputs:
      - type: F32
        dimensions: [1]
    args:
      modulus: 360.0

  sine:
    model: "./sinemodel.tflite"
    inputs:
      - mod360
    outputs:
      - type: F32
        dimensions: [1]

  serial:
    out: serial
    inputs:
      - rand

  identity:
    proc-block: "./identity"
    inputs:
      - mod360
      - sine
    outputs:
      - type: F32
        dimensions: [1]
      - type: F32
        dimensions: [1]

  debug_output:
    out: serial
    inputs:
      - rand
      - identity.0 # mod360
      - identity.1 # The sine output
```

The sections on this reference page are organized to reflect the structure of
the Runefile itself.

## Image

The first item in a Runefile is the `image`. This specifies the functionality
that will be provided to the Rune by the runtime.

The only image supported at the moment is `runicos/base`.

```yaml
image: runicos/base
```

## Pipeline

The main concept in a Runefile is that of the "pipeline". This is a directed
acyclic graph specifying how data is transformed as it passes through the Rune.

The `pipeline` is a dictionary of key-value pairs where the key attaches a name
to a particular stage.

### Common Properties

There are several types of stages, but most will share some common properties.

#### Arguments

A stage may specify `args` that can be used to modify how data is generated or
transformed. This is a free-form dictionary of key-value pairs where the value
can be a primitive type (e.g. numbers and strings) or a list of primitive types.

Examples of this may be providing the sample rate to an audio capability or
the list of labels to use when classifying.

```yaml
pipeline:
  audio:
    capability: SOUND
    args:
      hz: 16000

  label:
    proc-block: "hotg-ai/rune#proc_blocks/label"
    args:
      labels:
        - silence
        - unknown
        - up
        - down
        - left
        - right
```

#### Inputs

The `inputs` property contains a list of strings specifying which stages a
particular stage may receive input from. This is typically just the stage's
name, but in cases when a stage may have multiple outputs the desired output
may be specified using dot syntax.

Here is an example where the `debug` stage accepts data from `rand` and the
outputs 0 and 1 from the `identity` stage:

```yaml
pipeline:
  debug:
    out: serial
    inputs:
      - rand
      - identity.0
      - identity.1
```

#### Outputs

Each stage which outputs data must specify the type of that data using the
`outputs` property. This specifies the data type and shape of a tensor.

A stage may have multiple outputs. For example, if using a proc block to
classify the two most confident inputs and return both the labels and confidence
values.

```yaml
pipeline:
  label:
    proc-block: "hotg-ai/rune#proc_blocks/label"
    outputs:
      - type: F32
        dimensions: [2]
      - type: UTF8
        dimensions: [2]
```

Supported types are:

| Name   | Kind    | Description                         |
| ------ | ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `u8`   | Integer | An 8-bit unsigned integer           |
| `i8`   | Integer | An 8-bit signed integer             |
| `u16`  | Integer | A 16-bit unsigned integer           |
| `i16`  | Integer | A 16-bit signed integer             |
| `u32`  | Integer | A 32-bit unsigned integer           |
| `i32`  | Integer | A 32-bit signed integer             |
| `u64`  | Integer | A 64-bit unsigned integer           |
| `i64`  | Integer | A 64-bit signed integer             |
| `f32`  | Float   | A 32-bit floating point number      |
| `f64`  | Float   | A 64-bit floating point number      |
| `utf8` | String  | An arbitrary-length string constant |

The `dimensions` property specifies the shape of a tensor (multi-dimensional
array) in [row-major order][row-major].

### Capabilities

A capability stage is how information from the outside world enters the Rune.
This may take the form of an image from the device's camera or samples from an
audio file.

```yaml
pipeline:
  rand:
    capability: RAND
    outputs:
      - type: F32
        dimensions: [1]
```

Capabilities have the following properties:

- [`args`](#arguments)
- [`outputs`](#outputs)

Capabilities are specified using a `capability` key which dictates what type
of capability it is.

Supported capability types are:

| Name  | Description                                                      | Supported Arguments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| RAND  | random data generated from the runtime's random number generator |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| RAW   | raw data from a user-specified source                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| SOUND | 16-bit Pulse Code Modulated audio samples                        | <ul><li>`hz` - the sample rate in Hertz</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

For convenience the constants `@PixelFormat::Grayscale`, `@PixelFormat::RGB`, and `@PixelFormat::BGR` may be used.</li></ul> |
| ACCEL | Accelerometer samples                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

### Models

A model stage is specified by giving it a `model: ./path/to/model.tflite`
property which points to the location of a TensorFlow Lite model on disk,
relative to the Runefile.

```yaml
pipeline:
  sine:
    model: "./sinemodel.tflite"
    inputs:
      - random
    outputs:
      - type: F32
        dimensions: [1]
```

Models have the following properties:

- [`inputs`](#inputs)
- [`outputs`](#outputs)

### Procedural Blocks

A procedural block (aka "proc block") is a Rust crate which exposes
functionality for transforming data from one form to another. Proc block stages
are differentiated using a `proc-block: hotg-ai/rune#proc_blocks/label`
property.

The proc block identifier takes on the form, `path@version#sub_path`, where
`path` is the only required piece.

The `path` piece may be interpreted slightly differently depending on its form:

- A single identifier (e.g. `rune-label-proc-block`) is interpreted as a crate
  on [crates.io][crates-io]
- A `path` beginning with `./` points to a crate on disk relative to the
  Runefile
- A full URL is interpreted as the path to a git repository on the internet
  and will be used as [a git dependency][git-dependencies]
- A path of the form `hotg-ai/rune` is shorthand for a GitHub repository

More formally, a proc block path matches the following regex:

```
(?x)
(?P<base>[\w\d:/_.-]+)
(?:@(?P<version>[\w\d./-]+))?
(?:\#(?P<sub_path>[\w\d._/-]+))?
```

Common properties supported by proc blocks are:

- [`args`](#arguments)
- [`inputs`](#inputs)
- [`outputs`](#outputs)

Some well-known proc blocks are:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Inputs/Outputs</th>
            <th>Arguments</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Modulo</td>
            <td>Calculates the modulus of each element in a tensor</td>
            <td>(any)</td>
            <td>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>modulus</code> - the modulus to use</li>
                </ul>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

### Outputs

An output is the mechanism used to pass information processed by the Rune to the
outside world (e.g. the host application). Outputs are differentiated using a
`output: serial` property, where the value specifies the type of output.

```yaml
pipeline:
  serial:
    out: serial
    inputs:
      - rand
```

Common properties supported by outputs are:

- [`args`](#arguments)
- [`inputs`](#inputs)

Some well-known outputs are:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Inputs</th>
            <th>Arguments</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>SERIAL</td>
            <td>A user-defined component which accepts JSON-formatted UTF-8 strings</td>
            <td>(any)</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
