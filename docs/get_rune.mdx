Rune and the dependant toolchains used to generate bytecode require some dependencies. Rune is built using Rust programming language.

## Installing rune cli by building (Not Recommended)
You can install rune cli by building it for Mac and Linux platform by following the instructions provided in the Rune github repository - https://github.com/hotg-ai/rune/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

Because there are many dependencies that are nightly the rune binary can be a bit flaky.

To make it easier to use, you can leverage [docker](https://www.docker.com/)!

We have pre-built docker images that have been tested across all platforms and are stable.

Our images are available on [our docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/tinyverseml).

## Docker (Recommended)

With Docker we support the following platforms.
### Supported platforms
* Mac (intel)
* Windows 10
* Linux (ubuntu 16 and later)

### Rune Cli - Mac and Linux

You can use `docker run` to use `rune-cli` directly in your local directory. The following shell script will execute `rune-cli` using volumes in your local directory.
```shell
#! sh
docker run -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd`  -i -t tinyverseml/rune-cli /usr/local/bin/rune $@%
```

Save the shell script in your PATH variable and you are ready to go! Now you can use `rune` as a command on the terminal.

### Rune-Serve  - Mac and Linux
Similarly the rune-serve tool is also available as a docker container and can be run with the following command:

```shell
docker run -e RUST_LOG=INFO -v `pwd`:/app/static tinyverseml/rune-serve
```


### Rune Cli - Windows

You can use `docker run` to use `rune-cli` directly in your local directory. You can call the `rune` commands such as `build`, `run`, and `model-info` on the directory you have your Runefile, built .rune, and model.

You should use Powershell and the paths to the directory are not in the windows format (c:\path\to\directory) but in the 'nix notion (/c/path/to/directory)

```shell
# Call rune build - change your path. Here /path/to/directory containes the Runefile.yaml
docker run -v /path/to/directory:/path/to/directory -w /path/to/directory  -i -t tinyverseml/rune-cli /usr/local/bin/rune build Runefile.yml

# Call rune run - change your path. Here /path/to/directory containes the .rune file
docker run -v /path/to/directory:/path/to/directory -w /path/to/directory  -i -t tinyverseml/rune-cli /usr/local/bin/rune run my-built-rune.rune --capability=image:./path/to/image
```

### Rune-Serve - Windows

```shell
# Call rune serve from the directory that contains static.rune
docker run -e RUST_LOG=INFO -v /path/to/directory/static:/app/static tinyverseml/rune-serve
```

** Note about Apple Mac M1 Arm chip **

Currently Docker on M1 is still unstable and is not supported! We are working on this actively follow our progress
on (github)[https://github.com/hotg-ai/rune/issues/174].
