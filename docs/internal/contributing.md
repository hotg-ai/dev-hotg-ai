We have documented how you can build and contribute to Rune in the Rune's [github repo - refer here](https://github.com/hotg-ai/rune/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). 

We welcome everyone to play with Rune and add value as you see fit. The general directions where we would love the community to help are:
* Making rune build natively on all platforms 
* Creating processing blocks for various models and scenarios
* Adding support for additional hardware and platforms
* Building TinyML apps using rune :)
