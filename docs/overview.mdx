Tinyverse is an open platform for containerizing, shipping and running TinyML applications.
Rune decouples your ML application from the underlying hardware. Using Rune you can
build, test and deploy your ML models faster to a variety of end devices.

## The Tinyverse platform

The Rune platform provides the ability for Machine Learning Engineers/Application package
and run TinyML applications (called a `Rune`) in a Virtual Machine on various hardware.
The isolation and security of a `Rune` app is accomplished by using a capability based
mechanism.

`Rune` files are specialized bytecode (wasm) that can be deployed to various hardware targets and
contains both the model and the code required to process signals to features for the model.
As such the `Rune` are tiny and only contain exactly what is needed.
You can easily share your `Rune` for development, testing and deployments.

Tinyverse provides tooling to manage the lifecycle of your Runes:

* `rune-cli` to build and run your `Rune`
* `rune-vm` a virtual machine spec implemented in a variety C++/Rust/JS & Flutter
* `hammrd` a daemon service to help *privately*  collect labelled data for your projects


## Tinyverse architecture and components

Rune and Hammer use a client-server architecture. The `rune-vm` runs on your target
device and executes and manages the `rune`. Additionally, using the `hammerd` daemon
allows you to collect labelled data directly from the clients.
The `rune-vm` and `hammrd` daemon *can* run on the same system, or you can connect a
`rune-vm` to a remote Hammer daemon.

Runes can be directly embedded into your hardware or updated by the `hammerd`.

#### Rune Images

`Rune` is an orchestration tool for specifying how data should be processed,
with an emphasis on the machine learning world, in a way which is portable and robust.

The main purpose of a Rune is to give developers in the fields of machine learning and
data processing a way to declare how data should be transformed using a high level, declarative language.

Instead of needing to write code that manipulates data or needs to interface
with complex third party libraries for receiving inputs, you write a Runefile
which declares each processing step and defers their implementation to the `rune-vm`.
This `rune-vm` runtime then takes care of interfacing with the outside world and can leverage
existing third party libraries for data manipulation.

#### Example Rune run command

The following command runs an `sine` rune, attaches interactively to your
local command-line session, and runs an inference to predict the sine of random numbers.


#### Sine Runefile

```Dockerfile
FROM runicos/base

CAPABILITY<F32> rand RAND

PROC_BLOCK<F32,F32> mod360 hotg-ai/rune#proc_blocks/modulo --modulus 360.0

MODEL<F32, F32> sine ./sinemodel.tflite

OUT serial

RUN rand mod360 sine serial
```

Using the above Runefile we will build a Rune that takes in random floating points provided by the host's random
number generator.

```bash
$ rune build examples/sine/Runefile
...
$ rune run examples/sine/sine.rune
[INFO] Running rune: examples/sine/sine.rune
...
[INFO] Serial: {"type_name":"f32","channel":2,"elements":[0.486],"dimensions":[1]}
```

When you run these commands, the following happens (assuming you are using
the default registry configuration):

1.  Rune reads the Runefile and builds a `sine.rune` file in your folder. This sine.rune file is
    your image.

2.  Rune build also prepares the sine tflite model into your Rune. Rune also fetchs and packages
    processing blocks into the `sine.rune`. It will fetch `hotg-ai/rune#proc_blocks/modulo` from
    `github.com/hotg-ai/rune` repo and in the `proc_block/modulo` folder. You can also
    define custom processing blocks that can be called during this process.

3.  During Rune `run` process, the `sine.rune` image is loaded and the VM makes a request
    to the host for access to the `RAND` capability. The host can then provide floating points
    and the input is process and prepared for the model.

## The Underlying Technology

Rune & Hammerd is written in the [Rust programming language](https://rust-lang.org/) and takes
advantage of several features of the [Webassembly](https://webassembly.org/) platform to deliver its functionality.
